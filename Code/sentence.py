# Choose starting point (word in list)
# Initialize float numbers for each word in list (float represents probability of word being next)
    # Initialize count = 0
    # Initialize dictionary = {}
    # following_words_list = all words that follow starting word
    # total_following_words = sum of all words that follow
    # increment words by i = 1/total_following_words
    # check if dictionary keys in 
    # for each word in following_words_list
        # add to dictionary[word] = count += i
    # For all other words assign count (0)
# Generate random float number between 0 and 1
