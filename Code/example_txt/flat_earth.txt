You think
you're on a globe spinning
at a thousand miles
an hour.
That globe is spinning
around the Sun
at 60,000-plus miles an hour.
That solar system is flying
sideways through the galaxy
at half a million miles
an hour,
and that galaxy
is going through
the rest of the universe
at millions of miles an hour.
And you feel nothing.
In reality,
you are actually
in a giant planetarium,
slash terrarium,
slash soundstage,
slash Hollywood backlot
that is so big
that you
and everyone you know
and everyone
you've ever known
never figured it out.
I have a beautiful view
of the S4B
and the Earth here
all at once.
I'll try and get
a picture for you.
Our planet is beautiful.
It's not really a planet.
It's a great big plane.
A strange message of words
"Google Flat Earth"
were carved into
Mt. Rubidoux.
How would you feel if I say
there's absolutely zero
real pictures from space?
Flat Earth theory is actually
getting popular.
My children
will have to pay
for the lies
that NASA gives.
A lie is a lie,
even if everybody believes it.
The south pole, it's like
a 200-foot wall of ice,
straight up,
Game of Thrones style.
And the sun and the moon
are just lights in the sky.
I love movies, always have,
and so I try to compare it to
The Truman Show.
If you built a stage that was
a thousand miles wide,
how many people could you fool
besides just Truman?
Of course you're gonna have
questions. Everybody does.
Because, it's like, "Okay,
how does everything work?"
Here's a perfect example,
if you wanna see it real quick.
So like, those buildings
in the distance?
Right out there?
That's Seattle.
You shouldn't be able
to see it.
There should be
hundreds of feet
of curvature
between us and them.
You should barely be able
to see those buildings.
Science is having a problem
combatting what we're doing.
Neil deGrasse Tyson--
I hate saying his name.
We call him
"He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named."
--says that it's a growing
anti-intellectual movement
which borders on
the end of civilization
and democracy as we know it.
The reason why
we're winning versus science,
against science, is science
just throws math at us,
whereas we go "Hey, by the way,
there's Seattle.
You can see it right now
with your camera."
That's it. A picture says
a thousand words.
And at a high-level
NASA party out in the Hamptons,
they told him the GPS system
doesn't work out
in Antarctica
because the world is flat.
I became a flat-Earther 'cause
I tried to debunk flat Earth.
Everybody that becomes
a flat-Earther
does the same thing.
Flat Earth clues part 1 the empty
theater this is part of a series of
clues that can help you get your head
around both the design of the Flat Earth
system we live in and who has been
involved in the deception to hide it
from you the clue you have to look at is
built upon another conspiracy that has
been around for decades namely the space
program most of those watching this are
aware of the varying theories revolving
around NASA the Apollo program the Space
Shuttle the International Space Station
and so on the clue itself isn't based on
one of these highly debated topics but
the lack of one more specifically motion
pictures based on actual events this
like others in the series is something
you can check out for yourself
everything you need to reference this is
online to begin think of all the movies
involving space travel that you've seen
in your lifetime you'll start with the
obvious Star Wars Star Trek alien just
to name a few in fact if you go through
your own personal list you could
probably come up with over 100 different
offworld movies without breaking much of
a sweat that part is easy for the second
group try to come up with space movies
that aren't fantasy based you'll get a
list that has red planet gravity mission
to Mars 2001 things like that these
films will usually take on a not so
distant future theme and where we could
be down the road and it's still a pretty
good size list these first two groups of
films are encouraged by the authority
because they reinforce the globe bottle
through assumption the entertainment
system demands that the globe view and
solar system concept is a given
therefore the actual world view must
also be true or to put it another way if
you're using your suspension of
disbelief as you watch a movie like say
gravity then subconsciously you're
reinforcing the movie right on top of
the real world
the more of these movies you watch and
enjoy the more the lines blur between
what you want to believe and what you
actually know watch enough movies about
Mars and you will be less astonished
when NASA announces an actual mission to
Mars same with the moon other solar
systems and so on releasing the movie
2001 a Space Odyssey in 1968 right
before the actual moon missions was no
accident
it took the greatest director of all
time five years to make and several
people who saw the theater screenings
claimed that many military groups were
listed in the credits only to be removed
years later but 2001 is just a side note
of this clue for those who really want
to dig into Stanley Kubrick's hidden
vision I highly recommend the
documentary room 237 a link to it is
below as well now you are aware of the
first two groups of space films there
are those that contain generous amounts
of fantasy and those who try to paint
our near future these two groups are
easy to find the third group is a
challenge and again that's where things
get interesting the moon missions
concluded in 1972 and even though it's
still considered the greatest
achievement by mankind no fact-based
movies were made regarding it until the
right stuff was released in 1983 now you
might say that it only been 11 years and
maybe it was tough to get the rights and
so on but that's not what made the film
interesting the movie ran extremely long
for 1983 coming in at 3 hours and 12
minutes it was an exhaustive look at the
astronaut selection process the
competition and the training facility
itself but when the credits rolled three
hours later chronologically they had
only gotten to the low Earth orbit
missions just for fun Google the right
stuff movie and see how many space craft
you can find
it won four Academy Awards and did a
great job at the box office but the
Apollo missions were never touched the
only other major motion picture that
involved the actual moon program was
Apollo 13 in 1995 a full 12 years later
Apollo 13 only covered a single moon
orbit and no landing or close-up
reference to the previous missions below
them and after 1995 that was it nothing
Hollywood is known for leaving no stone
unturned with reboots and sequels to
nearly everything yet in almost 60 years
there has never been a single moon
mission movie based on actual events
hundreds of science fiction films
reference in it everything from Superman
to the Transformers but literally
nothing that covers the moon's surface
six complete moon missions involving
multiple vehicles moon buggies playing
golf and no one wants to touch it now to
be fair there was a TV mini-series in
1998 covering the subject it was
produced by Tom Hanks who got involved
after starring in Apollo 13 there has
been no professional production of any
kind since then again just for fun
Google from earth to the moon TV series
and see what you find the Y is easy and
the clue revealed if Hollywood makes a
movie about the moon landings and it's
indistinguishable from the real thing
then how do you know which is real it
raises some subtle questions involving
stage technique and how long they've
been in place if Hollywood could fake it
now then when did they first have the
ability there is one other movie which
stands out and I mention it because I
can't believe it ever got made is
Capricorn one the film's plot involved
the faking of a Mars mission and how
could be accomplished in short it's part
of the conspiracy world Bible
I highly recommend it and the link is
below to summarize all space movies are
encouraged by the authority except for
the ones that are based on actual
accounts those are not allowed the Mon
program has been buried in entertainment
because the moon cannot be reached it's
either outside the barrier or just a
highly rendered image like any planet
you see when entering a video game the
world is flat and this is just one clue


This is part of a series of clues that can help you get your head around both the design
of the flat earth system we live in, and who has been involved in the deception to hide
it from you.
This clue revolves around one of the most remarkable men you may have never heard of,
Richard E. Byrd and his relationship with Antarctica, and the secretive missions he
carried out there until his dying day.
Some of you have followed the legend of Richard Byrd through the hollow earth theory. We aren’t
going to be covering any hollow earth in this video, but instead focus on the man and his
involvement with the South pole.
The readers digest version of Richard Byrd is as follows: Born in 1888, he became an
American naval officer who specialized in feats of exploration. He was a pioneering
American aviator, medal of honor winner, polar explorer, aircraft navigator, expedition leader
in the worst environments in the world, and the youngest Admiral in the history of the
navy.
In addition, his list of awards takes up several pages in Wikipedia, including three ticker
tape parades in his honor. In short, he was Indiana Jones on steroids. Some people will
say that Roy Chapman Andrews was the real Indiana Jones, and you might be right, but
Richard Byrd beat Indy six days a week and twice on Sunday.
I mention all his accolades to paint a picture of credibility and trust. The governments
of the US and the world trusted his judgment and leadership, and they took advantage of
every chance they had to put him in charge of special missions.
The first large scale mission was an expedition to Antarctica in 1928. This was noteworthy
because even though he had just flown over the North pole in 1926, all expeditions from
1928 on were focused on the South. The expedition lasted two years, and during it, at the age
of 41, was promoted to Admiral.
His second Antarctic expedition ran from 1933 to 1935, and his third from 1939 to 1940.
While in Antarctica he also was an advisor for other countries who had their own expeditions,
including England, France, Germany, and building off previous countries expeditions from Belgium,
Japan and Sweden.
He then helped lead US Navy fleet operations in World War 2, was present during the Japanese
surrender in 1945, but then something strange happened.
He went back to Antarctica. Now some of you aren’t surprised, because he’d been there
since 1928, and I agree with you, it’s the how that’s interesting here.
His fourth trip to Antarctica wasn’t an expedition, it was a military operation called
operation “High jump”. Commanding an entire aircraft carrier group that included 13 support
ships, Admiral Byrd led 4700 men to the South Pole, for reasons that are still shrouded
to this day.
Some say they were chasing the remaining Nazi fleet, even though Germany had surrendered
a full year earlier. Others say that there was a Nazi base established in Antarctica
during the war, when Admiral Byrd was absent. None of these theories are important for this
video.
What we do know is that the US had sent an excessively large military force to the ice,
all under the guise of peaceful intentions.
During this operation, Admiral Byrd told a Chile newspaper this:
The most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that
they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which
the world is shrinking – recalled the admiral – is one of the most important lessons learned
during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time
has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty
that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety.
After the operation, Admiral Byrd toured the states, and gave interviews. The most interesting
of which as a national television show in 1954 called the Longines Chronoscope, a horrible
name, but a decent show. I’ve added a segment of it at the end of this video and linked
it in the description.
During this television interview, he first spoke of an area beyond the South pole as
large as the United States, which no one had set foot on yet. He then went on to say that
there would probably be expeditions year after year because the US government had really
become interested.
The interviewers then probed as to why the interest in the South, when any perceived
military threat from Russia (keep in mind this was 1954) would be from the North. He
went on to say that it was the most valuable and important place in the world for science.
It involved the future of the nation, an untouched reservoir of untapped resources, including
coal, oil, minerals, and uranium.
He added that at the time of this interview, there were seven nations currently engaged
in Antarctica including Russia, Australia, Argentina, Chile, and New Zealand.
During the interview the Admiral talked about planning the next military mission to Antarctica.
It was called Operation Deep Freeze, and ran from 1955 to 1956.
The mission was completed, and he supposedly returned home.
Now this is where you come in and say, so what, and normally I’d agree with you, except
for what happened next. Nothing happened next. The missions just suddenly stopped, and that
was it. No other expeditions, military or otherwise were conducted on the continent,
ever.
Then a treaty was put in place banning any country from doing basically anything. The
end.
And if you’re wondering what your missing, it’s this:
Admiral Byrd goes on television, says that this massive body of land, most of which sits
on a plateau 2 miles high, is rich with every resource you could ever want, ENERGY rich,
pristine, with no indigenous population or plant life, and every country that has sent
teams is ready to carve it up like a big turkey, not to mention there’s a expanse of land
larger than the United States they haven’t even LOOKED at yet, and out of the blue everyone
just calls the whole thing off? There are no environmentalists in 1959, this is the
land of Diner food and 20 cent gas!
I’m calling total BS on this one. The dollar value of the initial resource find would have
fueled armies of greedy companies. So what happened? They found the edge that’s what,
and the last thing they were going to do was let unsupervised companies near it, regardless
of the money. Even if hundreds of miles away, you couldn’t allow resource corporations
even into a safe area, and then years down the road as they expanded, tell them, oh,
sorry, you can’t go beyond this point. When the companies ask why, what would they tell
them?
And now the interior of Antarctica is off limits, with no revisions until the year 2041.
You can take tours of the outer islands, but there is a hidden line, enforced by the military,
that you will not be able to cross.
Because the interior is actually the exterior edge. It’s there, it’s hidden, and it’s
protected.
The earth you live on is flat.
Our very distinguished guest for this evening, is Admiral Richard E Byrd. The North Pole used to be a no mans land, but these are the days when, by buying a ticket on a commercial airliner, you can fly across the North Pole and drink a cocktail at the same time. In only three score or more years ago, about 35 years ago, our guest tonight, found out whether there was any land North of the North American continent. He made that first discovery flight, and I must say that Admiral Byrd, our guest tonight, is not only our greatest living explorer, but he's been an inspiration to countless Americans. Admiral Byrd, you've been to both the North pole and the South pole. Is there any unexplored land left on this earth that might appeal to adventurous young Americans? Yes, there is. Not up around the North pole because it's getting crowded up there now because they're finding out it's really useable, not only to live in, but militarily. But strangely enough, there's left in the world today, an area as big as the United States, that's never been seen by human beings, and that's beyond the pole on the other side of the South pole, from middle America. And I think it's quite astonishing, that there should be an area as big as that, unexplored, so there's a lot of adventure left down at the bottom of the world. Admiral, an expedition in which you are the advisor is now en route, what is that expedition doing? Well, that's the icebreaker adtka, and it's a reconnaissance expedition that's going down to the South pole area to make certain observations, and look for some bases. They will be back in April, and report back, and upon the information we get from that undertaking, we will base the bigger expedition that is to follow. Is that very definitely planned? That is being planned right now. So I'm willing to say to you that there will be a number of expeditions that will follow year after year at the bottom of the world, because the government has really become interested. Well Admiral Byrd I can understand how everyone is interested in the North pole, because it's so near our greatest challenger, Soviet Russia. But why this interest in the bottom of the world, nobody lives down there, right? No, it's pretty cold. There is only one permanent resident, and that's the emperor penguin, the little ones live further North. I'll tell you one reason they are interested, It's by far the most important and valuable place in the world for science. That's where the scientific groups from all over the world are interested. But more important than that, it has to do with the future of the nation, and those to come after us, even during your lifetime, because it happens to be an untouched reservoir of natural resources, and as the world shrinks with ever increasing acceleration, far flung places which we used to think were useless, like the North pole, and no mans land, become very useful. The bottom of the world, will be important, not only to us, but our allies. I was going to ask you, does it have military importance? It has some. Now as the world shrinks, it will continue to shrink with ever increasing acceleration, thus bringing these places closer, and in the future, and I can see a time when it will become very very important strategically. Has the development of air power increased the strategic importance of places like the South Pole? Very much so, very much so. Even now, if something happened, and we lost the Panama canal, we would have to control the islands just North of Antarctica, which are a part, of Antarctica. Admiral you speak of the resources of Antarctica, what are they, what are the natural resources there? Well, we've found enough coal within 180 miles of the South Pole, in a great ridge of mountains that’s not covered in snow, enough to supply to whole world for quite a while. That's the coal, now there is evidence of many other minerals, we're pretty sure there is oil, that coal shows the bottom of the world, now by far the coldest spot where that coal is, gets to 100 below zero in the winter. It was once tropical. So we think there is oil there, and there is evidence, probably uranium. Is it any secret, is there uranium there, that would be the only thing practical to actually go after I suppose. Everything else would be economically unfeasible wouldn't it? Well, as we recklessly expend our resources, the time will come, when we'll have to go after that stuff there. You know I avoided what you said about uranium, I'm not sure, I don't want to fight over the Antarctic. Is there a competition among other nations as to trying to get information about Antarctica and to possibly secure some of these resources? Well, yes. There are now several nations very much interested. Russia is interested tremendously that I am sure. Australia has an expedition down there, the Argentines, Chile, New Zealand, Britain, and so on. Now you can understand those people being interested because they live down there, the New Zealanders, the Argentines, the Chileans, and the Australians, and so, we don't do much about claiming anything. Admiral, you make it sound crowded. Are there that many expeditions down there or in route there? Well you know, as I said, it's the most peaceful place in the world, but I don't think it will be for long because of this intense interest on the part of other nations and this nation.
this clue looks into the USGS otherwise
known as the map makers of the world and
a few surprising things that they and
others have in common with the Flat
Earth idea all the reference links are
provided in the description below and I
encourage you to check them out for
those of you outside the United States
usgs stands for United States Geological
Survey a scientific branch of the US
government formed in 1879 and with the
help of the ever-expanding American
Empire they quickly became the premier
map makers of the known world currently
they have around 9,000 employees and an
annual budget of over a billion dollars
a year they also have extensive science
departments covering biology geography
geology hydrology and many programs tied
to them their motto since the 1990s has
been science for a changing world I'm
going to show you how true that really
is what does this large really boring
government group have to do with the
Flat Earth to understand that you have
to look into their origins which is in
geography to do this you'll need to open
another page that specializes in maps
the maps you see in this video are from
Wikipedia but there are others you can
reference as well the wiki list of map
projections isn't much to look at as a
whole although there are a number of
interesting takes in the world view not
only do they have just about every
perspective when it comes to the land we
live on but some detailed information on
where the map originated including name
type the origin or creator and the year
the map perspective was proposed now
some of these will be very familiar
especially the ones that you would see
on your classroom wall there are a
number of variations here but the one
that has been debated on recently would
be this one the galls Peters
which accurately shows the size
difference between the continents the
most obvious clue being that the white
continent of Greenland is actually tiny
compared to Africa but I digress if you
keep going down through all the
different shapes you'll get into
circular maps but only one of these is a
top-down perspective that shows the
continents in the center surrounded by
an unbroken Ring of ice in wiki it's
called the azimuthal equidistant and
just to make it easier I'm going to
abbreviate and call it a e for short why
is this map so interesting well if
you're looking at the wiki page you'll
spot a few reasons the first is that in
the notes section of the map and I quote
used by the USGS in the National atlas
of the United States it also mentions
that it is used as the emblem of the
United Nations of all the maps on this
screen it is the only one that
references a group of any kind and if
you keep this page open and navigate
over to the Flat Earth section of wiki
you'll notice towards the bottom of the
page a similar map I've referenced it
here and you can tell quite easily it's
identical but not referenced or link as
the AE model to make things even more
strange we go back to the USGS model and
you see that it was first proposed a
thousand years ago
and you may think well that's a bad link
so you compare it with the person who
proposed it and you get this guy al
biruni who was al biruni while he lived
around a thousand years ago it was
considered one of the greatest scholars
of his era schooled in multiple Sciences
have you ever heard of him I hadn't
maybe it's multiple bad references in
wiki well no because NASA knows who he
is and named this moon crater after him
so why is the usgs using a version of
the world map designed by a thousand
year old persian scientist because it's
correct
that's why so to be clear let's compare
them again the United Nations flag the
USGS official map of the earth and the
Flat Earth model all identical but one
isn't recognized and instead ridiculed
as an outdated look at the world and
this is one of those political quandary
x' that the authority gets stuck in the
short version is this the government is
on the same page as the Flat Earth but
they can't admit it even in confidence
we know the earth isn't flat they say
but it really is
we know you use the same map as we do
but ours is just an image and anyone who
says differently is obviously crazy it
makes you wonder how long the usgs has
been using that model as an official
reference the United Nations started
using it for their logos in 1945 and
then made some final adjustments in 1947
and the UN flag also raises a few
questions like why isn't Antarctica
represented on the map is it supposed to
be assumed in the outer circle or
perhaps the spiky olive branches on the
outside they don't mention it anywhere
online
and this is what I like to focus on the
gaps the holes in the plot the
unanswered questions
the USGS using the same map as the Flat
Earth but not saying why not recognizing
it or that you can't link the very same
image from the Flat Earth wiki back to
the actual AE definition of the
projection the authority figured out in
the 1950s all the borders of our
enclosed world and have done a great job
hiding it over the decades but the world
is a complex place and there are clues
out there just lying around.
this clue covers the near-perfect design
of the Flat Earth model it will break
down some of the logic behind the
decisions made it sounds like a big task
and it is but to start let's look at
something small like this little guy
take an ordinary Mouse and put it into a
glass cage it doesn't have to be a mouse
it could be a snake a lizard an insect
it makes little difference for this
exercise people identify with mice
because they're used to seeing them in
lab experiments mice also don't have any
sinister connotations they're seen as
relatively innocent in benign the
perfect test subject as it were I have
yet to meet anyone who has a bias
against the lab mouse so the mouse goes
into the box for the first time and the
reaction is always the same it explores
its surroundings and more importantly
tests the barrier around it probing for
exits or potential exits the mouse
inspects every inch of its new glass
home and at some point settles into the
acceptance that the walls are indeed
solid and then it may be there for a
while every so often it will repeat the
process again checking the boundaries of
the cage just in case something has
changed what it doesn't do is act like
it would in the wild because it realizes
that it's in a form of captivity
the glass box doesn't even remotely
resemble its natural environment you
could put this box in the middle of a
forest ooh the mouse may feel slightly
better about its situation but it still
knows that it's been trapped against its
will and will settle into a non-native
lifestyle you could take all the other
small animals that could be substituted
for a mouse the snake the lizard the
insect it makes no difference the result
will invariably be the same repeated
probing for escape routes
then acceptance take the same animal and
now put it into the
of a hundred mile square wildlife
preserve surrounded on all sides by a
similar type of glass enclosure the
creature doesn't even bother to rush the
size of the preserve and start testing
the boundaries mostly because it's out
of visual range it could be days or even
weeks before it even encounters a single
fence the animals routine is spent doing
what it normally would do it eats it
sleeps it breathes it does everything
that it would naturally do in the wild
if one day the animal approaches the
fence there might be some curiosity but
any anxiety is quickly resolved by just
turning around and heading back into the
vast expanse from which it came the
fence does not pose a potential problem
for the animals in the preserve because
it is so small compared to the expanse
they live it and dwelling on it doesn't
hold any interest we're assuming here
that the fence is high enough to
discourage flying creatures as well deep
enough to stop burrowing classes and if
you want reaches the floor of any nearby
bodies of water stopping any clever
aquatic types the point here is that all
creatures great and small inside a giant
wildlife preserve when encountering the
fence wouldn't care they would all in
their own way
just shrug and move on with their lives
however if you take a human male or
female regardless of education or
nurturing and put them in the exact same
Wildlife Sanctuary the response would be
quite different when the human
approaches the glass fence they don't
see it as a minor distraction they pause
they wonder and more importantly they
ask questions either internally or
amongst others why is the fence here how
far does it reach can I dig underneath
or climb over or go around it these
questions continue in a way you might
imagine but eventually a bigger question
jumps to the top of the list who built
the fence it is that which changes not
only the type of questions being asked
but how the human being or beings look
at their world the giant wildlife
preserve suddenly gets smaller each new
fence border discovered starts to
artificially constrict their expanse
even though the dimensions haven't
before long the preserve their home
loses some of its relevance the fence is
a reminder of the unknown it provokes
fear and endless speculation within the
human given enough time the importance
of the preserve continues to be reduced
especially in relation to the fence and
the reason why it's so engrossing for
the human is simple it's there it's real
they could see it and maybe even touch
it adding more humans to the equation
increases the disparity of the situation
by orders of magnitude have you seen the
fence do you know how long it's been
here have you ever known anyone that's
been outside it it's older than us who
is responsible for the fence what can we
do to appease the group that created it
you can see what this might lead to a
long-lasting group hysteria would
entrench itself within the population
grab hold and never let go the fence is
bigger older and wiser than they are it
humbles them it angers them and it is
forever it is their proof of a higher
power
maybe not God but certainly God like no
civilization regardless of technology
discipline or age would be able to cope
with the existence of it for the human
psyche there are just too many questions
that go unanswered life would never be
able to progress normally
to summarize a garden-variety wildlife
preserve would work for 99.99% of all
the world's life-forms for human beings
however you would need to make some
modifications or really just one big one
so let's take a look at a few examples
of how this could be accomplished and
from there expanded the first failed
example can be seen in the 1998 movie
Dark City this is a good starting point
to get you in the right mindset the
premise here is an advanced race creates
a small flat earth area complete with a
traditional dome the design however is
initially flawed in that they built the
city all the way to the outer edge
leaving no room for error
to compensate for this they altered the
memories of the human population on a
regular basis therefore repressing any
long-term investigations
however in movies there are always
anomalies like the police officer who
realizes that even though he remembers
visiting a place called Shell Beach
there is no way to reach it because
Shell Beach is outside of the flat world
and never existed he just keeps going
around the circular city that has no
exits in the end another man the hero of
the movie makes it to the edge steals
the advanced races power and creates an
ocean which really should have been
there in the first place move from there
to a movie released only four months
later called The Truman Show inevitably
all flat earthers have to take a hard
look at this movie from a technical
point of view the movie follows the same
lines as dark city but in a much more
relatable premise that of a giant
television stage built so that the
outside world can watch a person go
through his life without any knowledge
that he is living inside a flat world
surrounded by a physical dome the movie
is interesting on several levels
including construction using their
existing model of a small town bordered
on one side by a large Lagoon and
wilderness and the other a seemingly
expansive ocean while better than dark
city still had its flaws for one
it was less than 20 miles across and
even though Truman's desire to explore
was repressed there was still a chance
that he would venture to the outer edge
which is where the movie ended but for
the most part it worked
Truman believed the entire scenario
because he was born into it and then
lived 30-plus years without any reason
to doubt where he was which could be
said for any of us if it wasn't for the
end will say movie mistakes that the
studio fell victim to then the show
would have never ended and this then
raises hypothetical scenarios like how
many kids like Truman could you have
raised inside that dome 10:50 now
logistically you can see how it might be
problematic in keeping tabs on that many
kids especially as they got older but
with enough sleight of hand it could be
possible a fictional situation just like
that was made into the 2004 movie the
village and even though it turned into
one of those M night Shyamalan plot
twist things the premise was very
feasible a wealthy group of idealists by
a large parcel of land in an existing
wildlife preserve create a small town
from the 1800s and raise children there
they pay off government officials to
keep planes far away and spread a myth
that monsters live in the forests as far
as the kids are concerned they actually
are living in a small Pennsylvania town
in the 1800s and being born into it why
wouldn't they if the story continued
eventually the elders that founded the
town would all pass away leaving the
children to pass on the legacy free from
any burden of guilt that their world was
not what it appeared to be and keep in
mind this was done with very little land
manipulation and no dome this then
circles back to how many actors the
fictional Truman Show really needed to
hire other than the Leeds who did
product placement the rest of the town
could actually just live their lives
like anyone else use phone lines to call
outside go to restaurants watch
television at home and
so on but again I digress assuming the
technology was possible
how many people like Truman could you
keep in a dome the size of say a state
that was hundreds of miles across
probably thousands if you kept expanding
the size of the dome to a few thousand
miles well then you're talking millions
but when it gets that big something
interesting happens you don't need the
actors anymore start it up like the
village and within just a few
generations
everyone is oblivious and you can leave
them to their own devices starting to
sound familiar
in fact the larger you make the enclosed
world the less micromanaging needs to be
done it gets easier as it scales up this
brings us back to the missing
modification you need for the human race
to keep the storylines consistent and
remove all the hocus-pocus of monsters
in the woods or that you can't get to
Shell Beach you place in gradual
negative reinforcement one that creates
an illusion of choice say for example
that Truman went out in the sailboat the
same as before
but this time the dome was twice the
size and the simulated ocean far larger
how far would he travel before getting
hungry thirsty or tired the movie ending
is then in doubt and if you compare this
scenario where where you are now then
you start to see it look the Flat Earth
map again continents grouped in the
center surrounded in all directions by
hundreds of miles of salt water think
about how much further ancient ships
would have traveled if you could drink
what you are sailing on as you move
closer to the edge the temperature
starts taking a nosedive then you start
seeing icebergs if that doesn't stop you
then you run into what we call
Antarctica which is a steep climb two
miles up with no plant life or
indigenous livestock animals and if you
had the wherewithal to make it that far
you would still have hundreds of miles
of endless ice and snow it's easy to see
why so few people have gone the distance
compare this to the upper ceiling which
is much easier to maintain
you simply decrease the oxygen rates so
that every thousand feet up it gets more
difficult to breathe this slows down
exploration over mountain ranges and
discourages limited control flight such
as balloons also keep in mind that the
dome itself doesn't have to be that high
in relation to the outer ring with
commercial aircraft capping out at 10
miles and Rockets less than 400 the dome
would actually look more like a stadium
roof depending on how you wanted to
display things like the Sun Moon and
stars an enclosed world with these type
of safeguards would be able to sustain
an unknowing population for say what
4,500 years then you could artificially
introduce a globe model into the
scientific community before the
civilization technology reaches a point
that could lead to discovery and 500
years later here we are
a civilization inside an amazing
structure doing what we would naturally
do while the authority stands by the
gate and fears the consequences if we
ever found out for ourselves.
this clue covers the inevitable and
sometimes frustrating question of why
the authority would go to all the
trouble of hiding the Flat Earth my hope
here is to show you different angles and
a progression of events all of which
lead to a very changed world both
physically and mentally to open we have
to go way back to when the world was a
much more simple place you had your five
major religions including Buddhism
Hinduism Judaism Islam and Christianity
each of these groups had their own
version of what is known in Genesis as
the firmament or the flat circular world
enclosed by a solid dome-like barrier
from where the creator or creators
looked on i'm not going to explore all
the subtle differences between the
groups suffice it to say that it's
interesting that despite their
differences that led to acts of horrible
violence between them there was no real
earth model debate so around 500 years
ago the science community led by
Copernicus who probably had a little
help
introduced what we now know as the
heliocentric or globe model of the world
which in turn changed the solar system
galaxies and so on the religions seem
that this globe model was gaining
popularity feared a loss in the fan base
so they all adapted their religion to
include the globe model from their point
of view it was a small change from a
circular to a globe world and really in
a few generations who would remember
anyway the churches mosques temples
wrapped up their Flat Earth model in a
metaphoric soft cloth and put it in the
drawer with a good silver for
safekeeping remember this because we'll
come back to it later and hundreds of
years went by with science promoting all
the aspects of the globe
Mobe and the religions promoting their
beliefs upon this globe the world kept
spinning so to speak and everyone was
happy then in the early part of the
1900s you get this pesky explorer named
Richard Byrd he has family money all the
right connections and secures basically
unlimited funding and the government
green light to probe every piece of
unseen territory there is it was
inevitable I guess a young man who has
an unquenchable desire to see all that
there is to see and then granting him
the tools needed to accomplish this goal
he pulls a Truman and gets lucky
crossing the vast salt ocean avoiding
the icebergs arriving at the frozen
coastline and he keeps going he was
never going to stop one day after
crossing hundreds of miles of
high-altitude ice and snow Admiral Byrd
sees it a barrier and to him it's just a
barrier not the barrier he is but a tiny
speck in front of it it stretches out on
both sides as far as he can see and
straight up so far that he can't
discover the beginning of the arc the
great Explorer now has a new challenge
finding the shape of this thing it's
much like a blind man describing in the
elephant until you feel out the whole
thing what do you really know if you
look at the AE or Flat Earth overhead
map you see the problem to even
determine the scope of the outer wall
you have to circle it it would have
taken months if not years you could use
a series of ships going in opposite
directions or planes but there are
refueling stations that need be built
and so on his task was challenging to
say the least
Admiral Byrd kept laying the groundwork
of the great discovery until his
eventual death in 1957 a year later the
United States and Russia found the upper
edge from there the math was easy and
moreover you could actually see the real
world then of course there is the
decision or deception depending on how
you looked at it
the authority made the call to hide the
actual shape of where we live then
sealed off the outer edge from prying
eyes and created the space program not
only to reinforce the globe model but to
control it there was really only one
reason they cared about this and it
takes a while to process so let's look
at the immediate effects of actual
disclosure on work our way up to the
authorities biggest fear for this
exercise will look at releasing the news
today instead of say 1958
well 1958 would have been easier it's
much more relevant and entertaining to
explain it in modern terms we start with
a press conference by let's say the
United Nations who have discovered that
the world is indeed enclosed in a giant
hi-tech dome of unknown origin and age
the public reacts with Wonder and awe
trying to take in the sheer scope of
this announcement Facebook crashes
Twitter crashes entire mobile networks
crash it's like hitting a beehive with a
sledgehammer
news organizations around the world send
teams to the outer edge to confirm the
finding and the general public is glued
to their media devices that's the good
news
the excitement the revelation the
positive shock then the bad news starts
coming in waves some of which you might
not expect the first is the immediate
disbanding of NASA and all other world
space programs for obvious reasons most
governments will secretly pardon these
groups and keep them immune from
class-action lawsuits the lawsuits
themselves coming from NASA investment
groups claiming fraud regardless
everyone at NASA despite their good
intentions is out of a job overnight
and this is where you would say good
they deserve it about time they stop
lying to everyone oh but it doesn't stop
there because every contractor and
subcontractor that are exclusively tied
to NASA they have to shut down as well
fine
a few thousand jobs lost no big deal
and the ripples continue to spread some
bigger than others observatories all
over the world close their doors and the
reasoning is this if you've been looking
at the ceiling for decades and couldn't
tell it was a ceiling then what good are
you every University in the world that
has an astronomy or astrophysics program
well they don't anymore Stephen Hawking
his book writing days are over
Carl Sagan no more Nova in syndication I
guarantee it those professors are going
to have to retool their skills and be
prepared to answer one giant question
how did you not see it
ort their clues people start
finger-pointing and it will continue for
years and still my fellow flat-earthers
will say well hell that doesn't sound
too bad
so some nerds around the world lose
their jobs so what you don't get off
that easy
is what the finger-pointing at the
now-defunct NASA will then turn to
finger-pointing at the government who
directed the whole thing this is where
we run into some dangerous ground
involving things like the Ark of the
Covenant the Holy Grail and the Ring of
Power and you say you lost me I was with
you until you started bringing up
religious artifacts from movies and
you're supposed to be lost of the five
major religions we mentioned earlier
those being Buddhism Hinduism Judaism
Islam and Christianity none have been
able to produce a supernatural object
over the last five thousand years and
trust me it would be beneficial to do so
the Ark of the Covenant would benefit
Judaism the Holy Grail Christianity and
the Ring of Power
well that benefits someone else maybe
I'll leave alone for now the point is
that all religions are actively seeking
their leverage against science you've
heard of the division between church and
state well here it is advantage Church
the barrier becomes a giant religious
symbol and since it is backed by the big
five
it also becomes Universal the big five
then go into their drawer with a good
silver and pull out this belief that was
forgotten but not lost and say we knew
it all along
and science lied to us temporarily all
religions unite against science who has
been only moderately weakened by the
removal of their astronomy and
astrophysics divisions but the public
won't care because they will listen to
the group shouting the loudest and no
one yells louder than the church they
will scream with righteous fury the dome
was built by our God your God and the
people will turn to science and hear
nothing but crickets and that's where
the world changes because in times of
great stress the public will want words
and while religion has no shortage of
them science simply is incapable of
taking leaps of faith I'll take a glass
half-full approach and say that anyone
listening to this is probably an
intelligent rational person one who can
make informed decisions outside of the
conventional doctrine but for every one
of you there are hundreds if not
thousands of mouth-breathing troglodytes
who will not walk but run to the
respective house of religion and say you
were right about this what else can you
teach me this is what fills the current
Authority with pause the unknown
response to that question with religion
take the high road and work with what
remains of science to discover the truth
it's possible I suppose it's also
possible that religion will combine this
technologically advanced society with a
revitalized and aggressive doctrine that
then transforms daily life into
something that makes the book 1984 seem
like a Saturday morning cartoon show I'm
hoping that mankind will prove me wrong
but so far that isn't the case.
this clue looks into the
inevitable design question below the
surface or more specifically how thick
the Flat Earth design would need to be
to start let's quickly recap the design
features so far a basic dome structure
made up of advanced high-density
material thousands of miles wide and at
least a hundred miles in height the
ceiling of said structure being
projected upon by an Ultra High
Definition system using super LED
technology and a combination of 2d and
3d imaging to simulate all celestial
bodies including Sun Moon stars and so
on the ceiling is then protected by a
scaling decrease in temperature and
oxygen levels to the point where human
life isn't naturally sustainable above
four miles the lower surface of the dome
structure consists of an organic layout
of continents grouped at the center
ensuring that no land bridge exists to
the outer ring this is then surrounded
by hundreds of miles of salt water in
order to limit sea travel the salt
oceans are then adjusted with a scaling
decrease in temperature as the outer
area is approached to the point where
saltwater freezes forming icebergs
further reducing sea travel the outer
ring is then elevated to a height of
10,000 feet reducing oxygen levels and a
buffer zone of 300 miles is created this
zone is devoid of all life forms that
could be used as food further
discouraging land travel that all sounds
pretty good but we left out one thing
depth keeping human beings away from the
sealing is easy because it requires
higher technology protecting the outer
ring is a little more difficult but can
be accomplished with layers of negative
reinforcement protecting the actual
common ground is a different challenge
because digging is basic everyone knows
how to use a show
and most construction requires a
generous amount of digging in addition
natural resources such as coal oil
minerals are harvested through
large-scale digging operations so it's
safe to say that in a human population
is going to be digging a lot of holes
because it's easy and it's necessary to
continue their way of life that being
said how thick would you need to make
the Flat Earth model so that people
didn't accidentally dig their way
through you could use the same method as
the outside barrier and create a series
of undesirable layers ending in a solid
barrier but the ever expanding increases
in general population would create an
unnecessary risk if the bottom of the
Flat Earth was composed of say an
unbreakable material this would pique
the diggers curiosity and if repeated
all over the world would raise
suspicions of design while a solid
barrier works at the end of a frozen
wasteland where no one is venturing or
allowed it doesn't do much if it's found
in a mining quarry or someone's backyard
for that you need something that hasn't
been used up to this point a scaling
increase in temperature all the way to
an ignition flashpoint and then beyond
now you will jump in and say well of
course we all know that there is molten
rock below the surface we see it in
volcanoes and well volcanoes yes yes you
do and we've all seen the cross section
diagram of the globe earth which shows
ever brighter bands of molten structure
and so on which is why I included the
wiki link in the description that covers
the official view of the earth structure
and I quote scientific understanding of
the internal structure of the earth is
based on observations of rock in outcrop
samples brought to the surface from
greater depths by volcanoes analysis of
seismic waves measurements of
gravitational magnetic fields and
experiments with crystals at pressure
and temperatures characteristic of the
Earth's deep interior in short they have
no clue
what's below them none in fact the
deepest holes ever drilled which I've
also linked in the description only go
down eight miles to repeat no one has
gone below eight miles anywhere and
every drilling survey is the same a
scaling increase in temperature to the
point where drill bits stop working you
come back and say but volcanoes yes
there are volcanoes holes in the earth
where molten rock is produced under
pressure I might add
certainly that can't be artificially
created no we can melt rock right now
it's called a smelting plant what do you
think your car is made out of melted
reformed and polished rock we have the
technology to do this it all comes down
to scale create a large set of furnaces
at say 50 miles below the surface that
can melt and pump molten rock and you
say what would the furnaces be made out
of oh I don't know how about the same
dome material that can withstand nuclear
weapons so you take the molten rock
locate a few random access points on the
surface and the rest comes naturally
volcanoes also reinforce the Earth's
structure model that the molten rock
goes all the way to the core which then
in turn reinforces the globe model and
then we're back to where we are now a
smoldering globe flying through space at
high speeds that from a design
standpoint makes no sense
so how thick would the flat earth model
floor need to be oh for common you say
less than a hundred miles similar to the
ceiling and scale large heat generators
placed in a pattern a thin layer of
molten rock 10 to 20 miles down which is
really just a geologic pipe system to
help with the generation of terrain and
there you have it an efficient way of
discouraging all those digging humans
from reaching too far combining a
physical barrier with a mental one eight
miles down and you're going to tell me
what the entire core looks like give me
a break.
this clue looks into a topic I only
glanced at in the original guide which
is the southern hemisphere or in the
Flat Earth model the landmass is closest
to the outer ring I like to give credit
where credit is due and the long haul
title was given to me by a fellow flat
earther who did some of the same
research I did the summary of the video
is this if you are looking to show
someone how to view the Flat Earth from
a practical point of view this is the
example I would use I'm gonna show you
how strange the world looks using just a
few websites some simple math a couple
minutes and your brain you don't have to
write anything down unless you want to
of course I'll give you everything you
need on screen and break down one of the
examples as well I'll also link the
sites in the description for reference
first here are some websites that help
you calculate distance the GPS and your
phone already does this and you may have
an app as well but here are some
dedicated examples time and date calm
TripIt calm distance from to.net world
atlas calm free map tools calm and
travel math calm if your favorite isn't
listed here like Google Maps then use
whatever is most familiar to you now we
are going to look at two specific groups
of cities the first group is going to be
from the area around Australia including
New Zealand we'll call this group one
group one includes Melbourne Australia
Sydney Australia Perth Australia
Auckland New Zealand Christchurch New
Zealand and Hamilton New Zealand
the second group is going to be some
cities in South America all in the
southern hemisphere
I mentioned this because if you go high
enough you will run into a few cities
that won't work group 2 includes Rio de
Janeiro blur Brazil Sao Paulo Brazil
Brasilia Brazil Buenos Aires Argentina
Lima Peru and Santiago Chile again there
is a link in the description with many
other airports now these two groups are
interchangeable as you would imagine so
you can start or end with either Group
one or two the results will be the same
and just to make it interesting I'll use
a slightly different example which a
fellow flat earther did the legwork on
and show you that even these two groups
aren't exclusive so you take anything
from Group one and anything from group
two and you get some distances ranging
from six to eight thousand miles roughly
that's all I want you to do here is get
that part in your head noticing that the
route is bent because they have to
account for the curvature of the earth
all these directions are what you would
expect a straight shot over the South
Pacific Ocean now just to prove it's not
an exclusive route instead of starting
and say Rio and landing in Auckland I'll
start which should be the opposite side
in Cape Town South Africa which is
roughly the same distance on a globe
earth coming in at seventy three hundred
miles notice on the map it's still a
straight shot through the Indian Ocean
and not crossing any countries an easy
route I try to book my flight for this
example we use travel math but you can
use whatever is easiest in your country
like Priceline Expedia Travelocity it
will make no difference because they're
all tied to the same system and this is
when everything goes wrong
so the first leg the airline's don't
send me due east but instead shoot me
4,700 miles almost due north to Dubai
okay maybe we're just picking up people
it seems a bit excessive but I'll go
with it I'm probably comfortable in my
drinking vodka tonics anyway and from
Dubai it should be a straight shot home
to Auckland right or no now they send me
southeast to Melbourne a mere seventy
three hundred miles and then finally a
third leg from Melbourne to Auckland
coming in and around 1,600 miles I'm
rounding up or down to make the math
easier regardless the total miles for
this flight is almost double what should
be expected coming in at 13,000 600
miles in addition the trip took me 37
hours how long should it have taken well
in a triple seven about 12 now this is
where you come in and say well it's
probably an isolated incident or some
strange connection thing you know how
the airlines are oh no my friends we can
do this all day this roulette table is
rigged and there is no way to get a fair
game the first part of the clue is the
utter lack of nonstop flights from
anywhere in this hemisphere which is why
I give you multiple cities in each group
and here's the plot hole for you flying
from international cities like Sydney
Rio Santiago or anywhere else close by
you can't get a single nonstop flight no
matter how much money you pay I tried to
do this for an entire night and it was
like playing an online casino game one
that I was losing most of the time the
connections kept coming in like spam
Windows Start in Christchurch go to
Auckland start knock hland go to Sydney
start in Sydney go to Dubai or Los
Angeles or somewhere else that makes no
sense
some of these connections took the trip
over 50 hours to complete go ahead try
it yourself you may find one non-stop
but even then the strangeness doesn't
end there because the speed is wrong for
reference I included an optimum cruising
speed guide from a commercial pilots
forum that lists all the international
aircraft used in these routes a triple 7
the current state-of-the-art flagship
plane designed for maximum fuel
efficiency has a cruising speed of 640
miles an hour 70 400 mile
comes in at around 12 hours try to find
this route it doesn't exist it can't the
closest I came was a one connection
flight with a three hour layover the
total flight time was 20 hours 20 Tegh
away 3 is 17 not 12 and this might work
if the plane was doing say 430 miles an
hour but it's not in fact the slowest
cruising speed I found was an older
Airbus just around 593 but this is all
just numbers right it is until you pull
up the flat earth map and look at the
farthest two points which just
coincidentally are anywhere in Australia
and most of South America or my example
of Lower Africa which you can see isn't
West at all it's a shell game and a very
good one at that keep people guessing
with multiple connections in lay overs
jumping from city to city people just
sit in their seats trying to sleep
through it and then it hits you well the
pilots would not write they fly all day
every day certainly they would have
figured it out by now
some of them would get suspicious sure
any decent navigator will be able to
work out the speed fuel consumption and
odd connections but imagine what they
would have to get their head around
first they would have to ignore the
world GPS system that has been leading
them to their destinations without error
if you want some interesting side
reading check out the link on the
history of the GPS and I quote developed
in 1973 to overcome the limitations of
previous navigation systems integrating
ideas from several predecessors
including a number of classified
engineering design studies from the
1960s oh and by the way was created by
the Department of the defense the same
people that closed off Antarctica GPS
went fully live in 1995 so if you were a
pilot before then you might have been
able to pick up a breadcrumb trail after
that very difficult plus let's say you
did figure out that something was off
who exactly would you tell the FAA you
would be looking around and wondering
why you were the only one to see it and
then what you make the leap of faith and
see that the entire map system is wrong
never gonna happen
you might as well just tell them that an
alien spacecraft followed your plane
around for two hours we know what
happens then start playing flight time
Cocina for yourself see what interesting
things you can discover and while you're
at it show it to any pilots that you
know but don't forget to leave the words
flat earth out because that's crazy.
someone mentioned
to me recently that while the dome was a
very big concept it made the world much
smaller kind of like what Admiral Byrd
expressed in an interview all those
years ago this someone also said that it
made them sad which I understood and
while I did what I could to comfort this
person I realized that I could have done
more so this video is for the people who
look upon this world with their new eyes
and start drifting into a state of
melancholy to preface this isn't Jail
nor are you lab rats and before I'm done
I hope to show you a version of why to
start let's look at an old story one
that you may have heard involving
another enclosed world kind of like
yours I say kind of like yours because
the finished design that you are sitting
in right now took several revisions in
just about every aspect much like any
project you come up with ideas you see
what works and what doesn't and you
improve the process until you come up
with something that well not everyone
agrees upon satisfies the best of all
criteria one of the first dome layouts
involved a race of people who were
supremely driven by ambition they didn't
have a word for lazy or fear they absorb
knowledge very quickly incorporating
physics advanced electronics engineering
and drove their technology with energy
from the enclosed world itself and when
their technology had reached the point
where the dome structure was discovered
in its entirety there was no reaction of
Wonder and awe they just looked up and
squid
at the sky eventually those squints
turned into glares oh they had religion
to be sure and it was tied to their
daily lives but to them
this wasn't religion it was a challenge
almost like they weren't that impressed
hard to fathom right seeing that your
world had borders but instead of being
afraid
shaking your fist the sky with arrogance
but that's what they did so much
confidence and might that when they
found out where they really were a new
priority was created at first they
dedicated broadcast channels to calling
the dome builders out demanding answers
and ran them day and night at the end of
each cycle the words kept repeating we
know but arrogance ABB's at patience and
their demands were met with silence
which was taken as blatant dismissal
this fueled their ambition even more the
people withdrew all their efforts from
breaching the outer barrier and formed a
new plan if the creators were not going
to submit then they would build a bridge
and meet them at the gates so a building
was designed but to call it a building
was to call the pyramids a sand castle
it was the greatest structure ever
conceived at least to them it was to be
over 30 miles wide and hundreds of miles
high enough to reach the dome ceiling
itself where they would meet the
builders face to face they abandoned
nature completely and pushed aside
ecologic systems to accomplish their
goal for they cannibalized entire
mountain ranges which they used to
admire and love to acquire the raw
material for the awesome structure the
work crews built with flawless precision
and it was obvious that it was going to
succeed a bridge to the edge of the sky
itself the work would only pause
long enough for the mighty armies below
to look up and yell we come for you so
loudly that on a clear day you could
actually feel the domes shake and the
creators faced with their first great
challenge decided to start again and the
people were changed their language
fragmented so that the builders couldn't
continue the tower was dismantled their
technology removed and forgotten and the
people scattered a new group was
introduced to the dome divided in every
way imaginable
so that unity was next to impossible and
everything slowed down languages evolved
and devolved into other dialects and the
languages produced text which produced
different forms of culture and some
amazing things began to happen the most
important of which was the arts the dome
builders saw the artistic pool developed
into several distinct forms everything
drawn in any medium on a flat surface
everything molded that took on a
three-dimensional shape everything that
produced music all things that make up
the human form in motion and all the
written works pictures sculptures music
dance literature the arts driven by
passion it is the very essence of what
is good in humanity once this was
recognized all dome methods put in place
were to cultivate and enhance this
process land masses were adjusted with
geology and temperature to support every
kind of terrain with mountains rivers
oceans Plains forests jungles deserts
all of its stunning all of its
stimulating the human mind nourishing it
and the modifications continued with
seemingly endless shades of weather the
sky was overhauled a moon added and
layers upon layers upon layers of stars
so that one day when the people were
able to see further than there
own eyes there would still be something
new to see and the arts flourished but
there was a cost the languages and
division of cultures had put the
population at odds and wars were raging
at regular intervals the dome builders
debated if the price was too high
plans were drawn up to make more changes
until they noticed that the arts thrived
even through the worst of conflicts
producing grace and beauty
despite their burning world it was
wonderful and terrible at the same time
and the debate outside the barrier
continued to intensify until a majority
spoke out and said this world is a
creative force and we must see what it
leads to the barrier must be hidden at
all costs
so the globe model was put into the
population and both science and religion
adapted to it the arts grabbed onto it
like a new drug the creative minds of
the world exploding with new concepts
their universe was now infinite and the
rules changed science then led to
science fiction which opened up
everything else books pictures
sculptures dance and music all reaching
deep into space decade after decade of
wonderful possibilities rising above the
ashes that were at their feet and it's
not just the artists it's everyone you
affect others who affect others who
inspire others who build it paint it
sculpt it sing it who then put it up on
a pedestal and hold it under the light
and say this is a piece of who we are
and for every one of them there are
hundreds of others who for whatever
reason were unable to express the songs
and images and stories that are in their
heads imagination is far more important
than knowledge because it is limitless
it is your shield your sword against the
cruel
t of destructive forces there are those
right now who live in chaos whose life
is surrounded by a swirling nightmare
from which they think they'll never
escape these are the true warriors of
the world and they are far braver than
me I am humbled by those who suffer the
most know that mountains were built for
you
oceans were built for you all of this
was built for you your struggles and
your trials by fire it may be today it
may be tomorrow but one day the curtain
will close and this stage will be struck
and when the dust settles no matter
where you are right now you'll see the
big picture and have new eyes and you
will be shown what wonder really is and
as you leave this most magnificent of
theatres heading towards the next my
hope is that you'll pause look back at
the stage and say I was actually in it
you know right there in the thick of
things and it was a sight to see because
it really is a hell of a ride imagine
what the next one will be like
you.
this Flat
Earth perspective initially started out
as a problem-solving exercise that was
going to be built into clue 7 otherwise
known as the long haul but after some
research and a little patience it has
evolved into something that warranted
its own section and is a perfect example
of good things come to those who wait
so emails and phone calls than coming in
almost all of them positive several
people from around the world commented
on the southern plains
they said that while 95 percent of the
long routes in that hemisphere were
connections which in itself raises red
flags there were a few pesky nonstops
that seemed to contradict the overall
logic the question then posed to me was
obviously are they real flights could
they be put there to throw the Flat
Earth group off if it was a trick could
I figure out what it was and how it was
accomplished I accepted the challenge
and started my impression of Morgan
Freeman as he went up against the four
horsemen magician crew now admittedly I
was skeptical to start because the
flights went against the third rule that
being the Flat Earth has no shortcuts
only a globe has shortcuts as in magic I
had to assume the rule was not being
broken but only hidden or having the
illusion of being broken but first I had
to see the trick itself I had to see the
planes in question and see them make the
route anyone can list a flight but does
it actually go from point A to point B
with the help of several other people
this was then put to the test well just
about everyone with a cell phone knows
about GPS and
what can track things many people don't
know that even though it's a system
built by the military there is a very
public aspect to it so while your phone
is tracked at all times so are other
things most notably all air traffic now
if you're military you could view
military planes if you work at a cargo
carrier like UPS or FedEx you can view
transport planes the general public is
mostly limited to commercial air traffic
this can be viewed in several places and
the one I chose was plane finder dotnet
you can use others like flight aware
flightradar24 flight tracker it makes no
difference because they are all tied
into the same exact GPS system all these
sites do basically the same thing track
every commercial plane in the world from
start to end in real time so I spend day
after day looking at the plane finder
global map which you see here at any
given time it's tracking between three
to seven thousand flights that are
enroute anywhere in the world you'll
notice two different colors for planes
red and yellow yellow just means there's
a five-minute delay in processing and
only applies to the United States the
point here is in order to prove out
these flights that go against Flat Earth
theory I need to watch a few as they
cross either the South Pacific or Indian
Oceans the webpage updates automatically
but just to be sure I close and reopen
the page every 30 minutes or so and wait
for an ocean plane and I wait and I wait
and I wait some more hours pass days
pass and no red planes to entertain me
and somewhere in this process of me just
staring at these empty oceans waiting
for a plane to cross something occurs to
me can you guess what it is
nothing is
crossing these oceans not nonstops
connections multiple connections nothing
but that's not possible right the planes
have to reach their destinations so I
change gears and just watch the
coastlines of anything in the southern
hemisphere and I start to see it I
follow a simple plane out of Brazil on
its way to South Africa which by the way
is not part of the long haul argument
its offshore just a few hundred miles I
get something to drink and when I come
back it's gone hmm just a glitch right
so I follow another and another and the
same thing happens again
and again once the plane reaches an
imaginary line in the water
GPS makes it disappear then a friend who
is also working on this problem sends me
some links which I've included in the
description I encourage you to take a
look at them at first they don't seem
like much just an average flight log
showing speed altitude locations things
you could expect then you scroll down to
about 3:30 in the morning and the
location drops away and is replaced by
either the word approximate or the word
estimated this then continues for the
next five hours until miraculously
one hour before landing the flight log
reestablishes itself and the GPS system
shows the plane in real time about to
reach its destination so to be clear to
those who may not be seeing everything
here the flights are being dropped off
GPS and their flight data is also turned
off and stays off until they are almost
on top of their arrival point and you
say well that's how GPS works well no
because the northern hemisphere has
planes flying
over there oceans and then you say that
maybe it's localized southern hemisphere
thing and I say then why are all the
flights over or near land perfectly
tracked furthermore this is a us-based
system with Americans flying on vacation
every single day you're telling me that
those people aren't going to be tracked
in addition the vanishing plane act is
happening to not only the South Pacific
and Indian Oceans which I would expect
but also the South Atlantic which isn't
part of the Flat Earth argument there
are a bunch of flights that cross this
relatively small ocean between South
America and Africa and every one of the
planes is hidden shortly after takeoff
so then you say what would be the
purpose of hiding those shorter routes
in the Atlantic it's because of
something I didn't see right away if you
hide one flight you have to hide them
all showing the GPS routes in the
Atlantic but leaving out the Pacific and
Indian Oceans would raise different
questions so the logic here despite
being very sneaky is sound the third
rule is that the Flat Earth has no
shortcuts if you look at the as a muffle
equidistant map again and look close you
notice that while the South Pacific
South Atlantic and Indian Oceans make up
the lower sections on a globe they make
up the outer ring on a flat model in
that model there is no shortcut between
Australia and South America if you are
creating flight routes you have only two
choices you take the long way around
clockwise or counterclockwise and stay
on the ocean or you cut across the land
in the middle but if you cut across the
land you have to create connections
because on a globe
it wouldn't make sense to fly over the
top of the United States to get to South
America neither of these choices are
ideal so the authority came up with a
compromise disabled GPS and lose the
planes for every ocean flight in the
southern hemisphere then reactivate them
once the destination is reached this is
just one of the lengths that they are
willing to use to keep you from seeing
it don't just hide some things hide
everything so that maybe the topic isn't
addressed and some would come back and
say well nice going you just pointed out
a flaw in their system and sooner or
later they will fix the gap hmm maybe
but not soon I think remember this is a
rule not a guideline they can't change
the map so they have to work within its
limitations if they have a better
workaround I can't wait to see it.
as you can
tell from the title I'm taking a
different approach eventually I was
going to have to address the question of
what happens next or what we do now with
the information at hand if you've made
it through the guide and the first nine
clues then at this point you are either
buying into the flat model or on the
fence if this is the first one you went
to because of the title I recommend you
go back because we're not going to do
much in the way of reviewing but if
you're still with me then you would
agree that one the world you've been
taught has been kept from you and two
one way or another you would like to
prove this out so how is this possible
the authority in question who created
what you call the globe is guarding all
the gates they protect the sky the outer
edge and most importantly the education
system that shows us at an early age
what they want us to see nobody
listening to this has their own
spaceship or advanced rocket program
nobody actually owns a long-distance
icebreaker and while some of you may
have a private plane
I wouldn't recommend testing a military
barrier that technically doesn't exist
but then again you have to remember that
this is not the story of David and
Goliath the hidden world was never going
to be sustainable forever as a
civilization evolved the tools the
authority uses as a method of control
become more vulnerable I've learned many
things about systems over the years and
one thing that I find most interesting
is as layers of strength increase the
higher the chance that they can be used
to your advantage
but maybe I'm talking in riddles I
should be boiling it down to what can be
done by showing you what's being hidden
what's important and how it can be
spread to others without looking like a
crazy person
to be clear and I can't stress this
enough
do not start conversations with the word
Flat Earth think of it like Fight Club
the first rule of flat Club is that you
do not talk about flat Club before you
started waking up and watching all these
things you were like me you laughed and
mocked everything that was Flat Earth
you may have learned faster than others
but the knee-jerk reaction by 99% of the
people was created the day they sat down
in a classroom and stared at the globe
look at the videos not just mine but
others who are putting forward some
great arguments and ask the questions
that people can relate to I'm going to
introduce three very important questions
that you can use each with a statement
precedes it and each statement is a
motivation for a different group of
people if you don't fall into one of
these three groups then I guarantee you
know people that do the first statement
is this you are being hidden what do I
mean by that well this goes back to clue
7 and clue 9 which talked about the
flights in the southern hemisphere if
you are flying a plane over the southern
hemisphere your flight is not being
tracked how can this be used to find out
the truth
it's simple it's quick and it costs no
money no matter what country you live in
send a quick note to your local state or
federal representative and ask them this
question why are citizens of our country
flying over oceans without the safety
net of the GPS system and remind them
that GPS stands for global not partial
without GPS anything could happen to
your plane and no one knows where you
are
and while you're at it remind them that
the GPS system was built by the United
States Department of Defense who never
does anything small the system that is
in effect now has what appears to be
huge deliberate gaps in the southern
hemisphere only do not mention Flat
Earth just voice our concern about the
safety of you your loved ones and your
fellow citizens will they get back to
you possibly will they give you a
satisfactory answer not a chance because
they will only have what the military
gives them what this will do however is
create a unique buzz in certain circles
that may prove to be useful later the
more politicians or high-ranking
officials you contact the greater than
noise the motivation here as you can
tell is general public concern the
second statement is this wealth is being
hidden what do I mean by that goes back
to clue to and every other mention
regarding Antarctica in 1954 it was
announced on national television that
the continent was just millions of miles
of rich energy resources and by 1959 it
was sealed off like area 51 how can this
be used to find out the truth by
contacting anyone you know in either the
petroleum natural gas or mineral
industry this means Exxon Mobil British
Petroleum Royal Dutch Shell Chevron
ConocoPhillips BHP Billiton Rio Tinto
Glencore Anglo American and there are
many others find anyone in these
companies and make inquiries about their
prospects in Antarctica send them the
link to the Admiral Byrd interview and
ask them why if there are no
environmental conflicts regarding oil
gasps or mining why aren't they allowed
to even petition the idea even when the
world's energy resources are dwindling
more every day put the sound of money in
their ear they may not be able to break
through the decades of red tape laid out
in front of them but it will create a
buzz from a different side the
motivation of greed and of pristine
resources just begging to be harvested
and finally to preface the third
statement I need to thank all the people
who have sent me stacks and stacks of
biblical scripture asking me to stop
dancing around the title of the flat
model and call the structure what it
really is and you know they have a point
I have put myself at a distance because
I want to reach people who are outside
of religious faith and even outside of
general conspiracies but for all those
spiritual groups who have contacted me I
can now however say with conviction that
this third statement is this they are
hiding God despite what labels I put on
the flat model structure the oldest
names are from the oldest texts one of
those being called the firmament if the
firmament was indeed discovered in 1956
and it was deliberately hidden then the
ruling authority not only hid the
structure but evidence of the builders
and by builders I mean creators and by
that I mean what people define as god
hiding God could be considered one of
the worst ideas of all time and if you
were a person of great or small faith
you have a vested interest in any
evidence that would solidify and
vindicate your years of dedicated
service if a structure was found that
had for all intents and purposes the
handprint of God on it then the ruling
authority has no right to keep it from
you there are billions of people on this
world
who
personally dealt with the concept of God
and would like to know for sure if these
beliefs are well-placed or in short you
want to know the meaning of life it's
out there and it's been hidden from you
your motivation is clear go to your
church leaders your congregation and
tell them science probably found
evidence of God in 1956 and decided to
keep it a secret if you know people of
religious power send this up the latter
get the word out and see what comes back
between these three statements and
questions people will talk to people who
will talk with others and eventually
reach someone who knows this isn't a
grass root or groundswell movement that
takes a long time because the system
that has been used to mold and control
you these past years has been based on
speed and by that I mean real time all
it takes is a single video a memorandum
one whistle blower one key person and
everything changes not in months or
weeks or days but hours and in those
hours everything changes because of the
speed people all over the world wake up
and look at the sky with new eyes and
things start to get better one person
that's all it takes one person to come
forward and share what has been hidden
for so long maybe someone who is tired
of all the games maybe someone who is
gone year after year burdened by such a
heavy secret maybe you who are listening
right now who is looking for a reason to
come forward this is it and if you don't
want to walk into the light and be the
hero
I understand but if you can't for
whatever reason then be anonymous share
the message
and help us make this world better
because it can be better for everyone
else give this person an opening give
them the opportunity and give them the
support they need to help reclaim what's
left of our civilization because we need
it now more than ever I will keep
spreading the word for as long as I can
in hopes that everyone that hears it
start seeing things with new eyes and I
encourage each of you to do the same and
maybe one day we will learn to treat
others better than we treat ourselves
you
this clue looks into the recent past or
more specifically an odd but interesting
piece of conspiracy lore what I hope to
show here is an example of how an
enclosed system once revealed can change
the world very quickly and in ways you
may not have realized to start we need
to go back a little ways to a
controversial 2004 documentary called
astronauts gone wild for those of you
who missed this strange little gem the
summary is this the producer director
Bart Winfield sibrel went out to prove
that all the moon landings were
elaborate hoaxes to do this he set up
interviews with the Apollo astronauts
giving them the impression that the
interview was just routine he then
produced a Bible and asked each of the
astronauts to swear on the book before
the interview started the interview was
then supposed to be a series of detailed
technical questions designed to trip up
the astronauts during the process there
was quite a bit of tension and some very
uncomfortable moments including one
actual fistfight now I'm not
recommending that anyone actually go out
and watch this hour-long documentary for
me the astronauts have had to live with
his guilt a long time and leaving them
alone seems like the humane thing to do
what interested me and moreover what
piqued my interest then wasn't the
unoriginal questions the reporter posed
but how the astronauts reacted to the
Bible itself
none of the Apollo pilots would put
their hand on it and swear that they
went to the moon in fact most treated
the book like it was made of plutonium
this puzzled me for years because it
went against the basic rules of any
cover-up one of which is lie about
everything
now the pilots of the Apollo program had
done many interviews over the years many
televised it had been going through
their song-and-dance without really any
instances of contention so why not just
go through the motions again it is after
all just a book right people lie under
oath all the time
it's called perjury and every country
has an extensive system of laws and
punishments to deal with it these
punishments don't seem to stop the
people from committing perjury and you
can read about it almost every day
furthermore the astronauts were not in
court this was just a room sometimes
their own home so swearing on the book
would for all intents and purposes be
meaningless and this sat in the back of
my head for years because it didn't make
sense
why would astronauts trained by a very
large military science program be afraid
of just putting their hand on the book
and just tell one more lie well for them
it may have been more than just a book
it may have been a symbol of something
much bigger you see for you me and
almost everyone else a holy book is a
symbol of faith because the creator or
creators have yet to be revealed but if
you knew that the creators were real
then the book becomes something much
more tangible more relevant more
sobering or more to the point the Apollo
astronauts would have been lit in on the
enclosed system during their tenure with
NASA and over the decades this system
created certain truths for these men one
of which is someone could be watching
now whether the builders slash
creators are actually watching every
little thing we do can be debated but if
you have proof that they are real then
the thought of your every move being
scrutinized is a very real possibility
this is what you and I may suspect but
don't feel the Apollo pilots however are
a different story if they were shown how
the world really looked then their
attitude towards the book takes on a
whole new meaning in fact it didn't have
to even be a Bible it could have been
encyclopedia or a piece of wood because
it was the idea that made them pause and
if you're still not getting it then I'll
ask you directly if you actually saw
some of the creator's handiwork and knew
that there was a chance you were being
watched and there was a scorecard
involved would you swear against that
I'd lie about something would you roll
those dice and take the chance or to put
it another way everyone has gotten
frustrated about something then looked
up and cursed the sky would you still do
that if you knew that a creator was up
there and possibly listening that's just
one example of how knowledge of the
enclosed system changes people
the astronauts didn't want to roll the
dice and lie because there was a real
fear of retribution and while they were
confident that a bolt of lightning
wasn't going to strike them down they
also weren't going to push their luck
and we all take on the same approach in
daily life everyone who drives has run a
stop light we know when we see the
yellow light that it's too far away
so we hit the gas and hope for the best
especially if the traffic is light and
we aren't putting anyone in danger but
you take that very same intersection and
put a red light camera on it well then
things change don't they do you hit the
gas and roll the dice not a chance
you hit the brakes and hope that you can
stop in time because you are being
watched you may not be a model driver by
any sense of the word but you understand
this rule and this place and you don't
break it and this one aspect is why I'm
pushing so hard to see the enclosed
system revealed because as a
civilization we seem to be only as good
as what we can get away with this isn't
an issue with freedom it's an issue with
doing the right thing you know that
running red lights is a bad idea
the camera is a reminder of that imagine
all the things that would change for the
better
if the enclosed system was revealed
would you lie to hurt someone would you
rob a bank commit fraud or embezzle
would you steal anything unless your
life depended on it and while people
would still get angry and fight would
they maim each other would they kill
would anyone knowingly commit murder
would you bully or extort people for
profit in fact knowing that the world
was created would you do anything
malicious towards anyone
if the world is not a globe but instead
enclosed then Wars end
hate crimes end maybe not overnight but
quickly because you maybe for the first
time in your life actually accountable
for your actions you realize now that
you are a very real soul in this
enclosed system and you have a
responsibility towards your fellow man
one that can be boiled down into one
simple rule treat others better than you
treat yourself this this is why it's so
important to show the world as it really
is
this is why I am asking the authority
itself to open the door and let this
secret come through you've kept this
hidden for too long and the people who
live here with you have been through
enough this isn't about money or power
anymore it's about our very Souls the
essence of who we are
wealth and titles don't define your
heart hiding the entire world may have
seemed like a good idea at the time
but we have gone way beyond that have
you actually seen our home recently this
needs to be fixed and it needs to be now
the people won't forget the deception
but they will forgive you for it because
a truth like this will make them more
noble something we should have been
since the beginning
